# CDU: A CDU Simulator

CDU is loosly adapted from Hoppie's MCDU application and contains code 
genericised for alternate CDU models

The bulk of the code provides a framework for building model specific and
simulator specific CDU simulators on top of SDL2.

This repository also contains a front-end suitable for interfacing with
Precision Simulator X, and an incomplete front-end to interface with the
PS13 Broker.
